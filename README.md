This R script demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying flower species using the famous *Iris* dataset. Initially, the numerical features of the dataset (sepal and petal dimensions) are standardized using `scale()` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations. The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using the `sample.split` function. The KNN algorithm, provided by the `class` package, is applied to classify flower species in the test dataset, starting with \(k=1\). The script calculates the classification error rate, i.e., the proportion of misclassified test samples, and iterates over different values of \(k\) (1 to 10) to observe its impact on the error rate. Finally, the error rates are visualized using `ggplot2`, showing a scatter plot and a dotted line to help identify the optimal \(k\) value with the lowest error rate. This project illustrates the practical application of KNN for species classification, emphasizing the importance of parameter tuning for accurate predictions.
